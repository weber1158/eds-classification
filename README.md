# EDS Classification for MATLAB
**Functions for working with SEM-EDS data in MATLAB, including different algorithms for performing mineral classification.**

This repository includes several functions designed to quickly classify minerals from data collected using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) with an energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) detector. The `weber_classification()` algorithm is a novel machine learning classifier trained on 18 mineral standards with an validation accuracy exceeding 99%. In addition, three alternative classification algorithms have been trasncribed into viable MATLAB code from the literature to compare and help finalize the results. See the `donarummo_classification()` **[1]**, `kandler_classification()` **[2]**, and `panta_classification()` **[3]** functions for details. The Donarummo, Kandler, and Panta algorithms have also been transcribed into Julia code for those without a MATLAB license.

Moreover, this repository includes MATLAB functions for importing EDS x-ray spectral data (see `read_msa()`) and visualizing the data (see `xray_plot()`). Users may also import the metadata from SEM micrographs with the `get_sem_metadata()` function, and much more.
