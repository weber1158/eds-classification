# Installation
You can download the repository from the MATLAB Central File Exchange [![View my project on File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/images/matlab-file-exchange.svg)](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/170771), or open it directly in your browser [![Open in MATLAB Online](https://www.mathworks.com/images/responsive/global/open-in-matlab-online.svg)](https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/fileexchange/v1?id=170771&file=Tests/matlab_test.mlx) (recommended). 

The repository was developed in MATLAB Online, which uses the most up-to-date version of MATLAB. To ensure backwards compatability, it is recommended that users also utilize the functions in MATLAB Online.

To add the EDS Classification functions to the default search path:

1. Un-zip the downloaded folder. 

2. Execute the following command in the MATLAB Command Window:

```matlab
pathtool
```

3. A popup menu should open. Click `Add Folder with Subfolders` and select the un-zipped main repository folder. 

4. Finalize your choice by clicking `Save` or `Apply`.
